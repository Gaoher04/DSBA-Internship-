TASK6: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm (Level - Intermediate) Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. GRIP@TheSparkFoundation- #GRIPApril21 Decision Trees are versatile Machine Learning algorithms that can perform both classification and regression tasks, and even multioutput tasks.For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, I created the Decision Tree classifier and visualized it graphically. The purpose of this task is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
